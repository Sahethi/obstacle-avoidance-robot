# Obstacle Avoidance Bot

This project is to create a differential drive bot to avoid obstacles. The designed bot is simulated in Gazebo and was done by the help of [ROS Tutorials](https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros-projects-exploring-ros-using-2-wheeled-robot-part-1/).
The details are provided in this [PDF](https://github.com/Sahethi/ros-assignment/blob/master/Obstacle%20Avoidance%20Using%20ROS%20and%20Gazebo.pdf).
